Freenode has always been seen as the home of Free and Open Software, so it was natural that you could find us on the #selenium channel there. To maintain this openness, and inclusivity, we are moving our IRC Channel over to Libera.chat. It is has been created by the team that previously maintained Freenode.</description></item></channel></rss>
