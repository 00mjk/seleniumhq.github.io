      <description>Great news! Thanks to the initiative of our friends at Sauce Labs, we&amp;#8217;re finally ready to host the first-ever Selenium Conference. We&amp;#8217;re still working out a lot of the details, but so far we&amp;#8217;ve decided this first conference will be sometime in April and hosted in San Francisco.
In order to figure out the rest of the details, we&amp;#8217;re looking for feedback from the Selenium user community. Please take a moment to fill out the following survey.</description>

      <description>The Selenium project does not have an &amp;#8216;official&amp;#8217; presence here at Agile as it is seen as a &amp;#8216;test after&amp;#8217; tool rather than &amp;#8216;test first&amp;#8217; &amp;#8212; even though it provides the magic of the &amp;#8216;test first&amp;#8217; frameworks&amp;#8230; But there is a small, unofficial contingent of recognizable faces around that can help people out and some sessions on it.
