[IDE](//selenium.dev/selenium-ide) (Integrated Development Environment)
is the tool you use to develop your Selenium test cases. Itâ€™s an easy-to-use Chrome
and Firefox extension and is generally the most efficient way to develop
test cases. It records the users' actions in the browser for you, using
existing Selenium commands, with parameters defined by the context of
that element. This is not only a time-saver but also an excellent way
of learning Selenium script syntax.
