Router The Router takes care of forwarding the request to the correct component.
It is the entry point of the Grid, all external requests will be received by it. The Router behaves differently depending on the request. If it is a new session request, the Router will forward it to the Distributor (where the new session creation will be handled).</description></item><item><title>Setting up your own</title><link>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/ko/grid/grid_4/setting_up_your_own_grid/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/ko/grid/grid_4/setting_up_your_own_grid/</guid><description>Page being translated from English to Korean.

Different Modes of Grid setup in Selenium 4: Standalone Hub and Node Distributed Docker Standalone Mode: The new Selenium Server Jar contains everything you&amp;rsquo;d need to run a grid. It is also the easiest mode to spin up a Selenium Grid. By default the server will be listening on http://localhost:4444, and that&amp;rsquo;s the URL you should point your RemoteWebDriver tests.</description></item></channel></rss>
