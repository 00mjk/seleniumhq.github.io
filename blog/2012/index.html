<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1874863">Automated Software Testing: An Example of a Working Solution</a> is an interesting take on designing an automation system for the US DoD. It sure as heck isn&#8217;t how I would do it, but I can understand how this context might lead to this solution. And it seems like it is Eclipse based which is even worse a decision. 🙂</li>
<li><a href="http://www.devto.ca/2012/05/5-tips-on-finding-a-mobile-job-in-toronto/">5 Tips on Finding a Mobile Job in Toronto</a> is pretty focused, but also applies to non-mobile jobs outside of Toronto.</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/alp82/abmash">Abmash</a> aims to deal with the element location problem only using the visible cues a user could see. In my experience, this leads to scripts that work fine &#8212; until you need to deal with multiple languages at which point it falls on its face. Hard. But&#8230;</li>

            <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2012/announcing-selenium-2-22/"><h2>Announcing Selenium 2.22</h2></a>
            <p>It&#8217;s been a while since the last Selenium release, but I&#8217;m happy to announce that Selenium 2.22 is now <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/download/">available for download</a>. This is a big release for us and features two major changes.</p>
<p>The first is that<strong> Selenium 2.22 is the first version that requires Java 6</strong> in order to run. This has been the case for the Selenium Server for some time, but this is the first time the client code has required Java 6. Since Java 5 was <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/eol-135779.html">&#8220;end of lifed&#8221; in 2009</a>, we don&#8217;t expect this to impact many users.</p>
<p>The second major change is that <strong>we are now providing a standalone IE server for use with the WebDriver API</strong>, similar to the one used by the chrome driver. You can get it from the normal download page. This will allow us to update our IE support independently of the rest of the library (again, mirroring how Chrome is supported) For now, there&#8217;s a legacy fallback mode you can use that&#8217;ll use the same DLL we&#8217;ve always used which can be activated by setting the DesiredCapability &#8220;useLegacyInternalServer&#8221; to boolean &#8220;true&#8221; when requesting your IE Driver instance.</p>
<p>Of course, as well as these major changes, there&#8217;s the usual host of updates and improvements. We&#8217;re continuing to refine the new SafariDriver, and we&#8217;re happy to announce native events for Firefox 12. You can check out the other updates in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/java/CHANGELOG">CHANGELOG</a>.</p>

            <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2012/selenium-conf-community/"><h2>Selenium Conf: Community</h2></a>
            <p>In this series of blog posts we&#8217;ve introduced one of the keynotes and talked about some of the great presentations you&#8217;ll see at Selenium Conf &#8217;12, but so far we&#8217;ve missed the most important aspect of the entire event: you.</p>
<p>For me, one of the highlights of any conference is the chance to meet other members of the community, make new friends and talk about all things interesting (and perhaps even tangentially related to the conference!) To help this process along, we&#8217;ve avoided scheduling everything down to the last minute. Instead, we&#8217;ve left plenty of time in the B track for an unconference. You&#8217;ll get to pick the talks and have a chance to have your voice heard. Last year, there were some great talks on the equivalent track, and I think we&#8217;ll see the same this year too!</p>
<p>If the idea of standing up and talking for 30 minutes in front of an audience seems a little daunting, you can dip your toes in the water by volunteering for a lightning talk: 5 minutes of concentrated goodness! Come prepared with a topic and perhaps a handful of slides 🙂</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not all formal talks, either. As well as the many members of the selenium community who&#8217;ll be attending the conference, there will be many of the core development team. There&#8217;ll be a chance to ask Simon why we&#8217;re not using git yet, get feedback on some of the ways you&#8217;re using Selenium, or just chew the fat. There will be a drinks on the 17th at a London pub, too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really looking forward to meeting all of you, and hearing the tall testing stories, and finding out how you&#8217;re pushing the boundaries. of web automation. If you&#8217;ve still not <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/tickets/">bought a ticket</a>, there&#8217;s still time to. Come along and join us! If you&#8217;ve already bought your ticket, what kind of things are you looking forward to?</p>

            <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2012/selenium-conf-speakers/"><h2>Selenium Conf: Speakers</h2></a>
            <p>I may be biased, but I think <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/">Selenium Conf &#8217;12</a> is going to be great. There are talks aimed at every level of Selenium user. We&#8217;ve got<a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers/#MD"> experience</a> <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers/#NS">reports</a>, so you can learn from the trials and tribulations of others. There are talks about using Selenium in unusual ways, such as <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers/#MK">performance testing</a>, or<a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers/#AP"> automated security testing</a>, so you can see new ideas and approaches.</p>
<p>There are technical talks, such as the one Jim Evans is giving on lessons learned from <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers/#JE">developing the IE driver</a>, so you can learn a little bit more about how Selenium works and <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers/#LD">Luke Daley&#8217;s talk</a> about <a href="http://www.gebish.org/">Geb</a> is bound to be fun.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a fan of <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/">Selenium IDE</a>, then the <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers">talk on the SauceBuilder</a> will be a &#8220;must see&#8221;. We&#8217;ll also have the current owners of Selenium IDE attending the conference, so you&#8217;ll get a chance to pick their brains on the future of the tool.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re someone who enjoys living in the future, then the mobile focused talks, such as Andreas Tolf Tolfson&#8217;s talking about <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers#ATT">OperaDriver on mobile devices</a>, or Dante Briones talking about <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers#DB">testing mobile apps on iOS</a> will be interesting. And Jason Huggins will be talking about <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers#JH">robots</a>. What&#8217;s not to love?</p>
<p>Better still, we&#8217;ve left space in the schedule in Track B for an unconference. If you put forward a talk this year that wasn&#8217;t accepted, or if you&#8217;ve got something you feel the Selenium community should hear, now&#8217;s your chance! If you&#8217;ve only got a little to say, or just want to make a single point, then you&#8217;re really going to enjoy the lightning talks!</p>
<p>All of this is available for the<a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/tickets/"> cost of the ticket</a>, which you can still buy. Don&#8217;t wait! Come to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23seconf">#SeConf</a>!</p>

            <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2012/selenium-conf-keynotes-liz-keogh/"><h2>Selenium Conf Keynotes: Liz Keogh</h2></a>
            <p>The tickets for <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/">Selenium Conf &#8217;12</a> are still on sale for about another week, so there&#8217;s still time for you to <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/tickets/">buy your tickets</a>. In case you&#8217;ve not already gone to the <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org">conference site</a> to see the great line up, this week we&#8217;ll be letting you know what to expect!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really pleased to announce that <a href="http://lunivore.com/">Liz Keogh</a>, who is a core member of the Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) community and is one of the stalwarts of the London Agile community, as well as a haiku poet, is going to be one of our keynotes! If you&#8217;ve ever seen <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/lunivore">Liz</a> speak then you&#8217;ll know just how much a treat we&#8217;re in for. She&#8217;s got great things to say and always says them in a thoroughly engaging way.</p>
<p>Liz&#8217;s keynote is titled &#8220;How to Test the Inside of Your Head&#8221;. When we test code and find it doesn&#8217;t do what we thought it did, we change it. But, she asks, wouldn&#8217;t it be great if we didn&#8217;t have to write the wrong code in the first place? In the talk, Liz will show how we can use examples and scenarios to break the models we make inside our own heads, helping us to avoid premature commitments and their follow-through &#8211; whether in code or in life.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really looking forward to it! I&#8217;m sure you are too.</p>

            <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2012/selenium-conference-2012/"><h2>Selenium Conference 2012</h2></a>
            <p>Good news, everybody! <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/">Selenium Conf &#8217;12</a> is getting closer! We recently <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers/">selected the speakers</a> for the conference, and it&#8217;s going to be a great mix of talks, spanning the full range of subjects from the very practical to the deeply technical. I&#8217;m promised that there will be robots.</p>
<p>Selenium Conf isn&#8217;t just about the planned talks, it&#8217;s also about the community. On the final day, there will be an unconference, so if there&#8217;s something you feel passionately about and feel the world should know, now&#8217;s your chance. You&#8217;ll not only have a chance to talk to and meet other selenium users, but also many of the core team members.</p>
<p>The conference runs from the 16-18 April in London. <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/tickets/">Tickets are still available</a>! We&#8217;re looking forward to seeing you there.</p>

            <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2012/support-for-ancient-browsers/"><h2>Support for Ancient Browsers</h2></a>
            <p>The first code checked into the Selenium project&#8217;s public repository was in November, 2004. We&#8217;re now in 2012. In the intervening years there have been many browsers released. The last browser we officially stopped supporting was Firefox 2.0, and it&#8217;s time to review the list of browsers again.</p>
<p>We periodically review the list of supported browsers as the more changes there are between the oldest version of a browser that we support and the most recent, the harder it is for us to add new features and maintain those that already exist. Balanced against the cost of maintaining the selenium code base itself are your tests; we know that your users might not be updating their browsers to the latest and greatest, and we know that you&#8217;ve still got to prove your app works on all the browsers that are important to you. That&#8217;s why what&#8217;s below is just our plan, and we&#8217;re talking about it now to let you have your say.</p>
<p>Looking at the market share of the browsers out there helps us make an informed choice about what it makes sense to support. This will most likely mean:</p>
<p><strong>Firefox</strong>: the Firefox market appears to be split between those on 3.6 and those on the new rapid release schedule. Given this, we are thinking of officially supporting Firefox 3.6, and the last, latest and next release of Firefox (currently Firefox 9-11) as well as any ESR releases. The market share for Firefox versions 3.0 and 3.5 is tiny, and the effort to keep them working with selenium is disproportionately high.</p>
<p><strong>Internet Explorer</strong>: <a href="http://www.ie6countdown.com/">Despite Microsoft&#8217;s efforts</a>, IE 6 is still a popular browser, particularly in the workplace. We will continue to support IE versions 6 and up.</p>
<p><strong>Safari</strong>: Safari 3 is now ancient and has been superseded by newer releases. We plan on only supporting Safari 4 and 5.</p>
<p><strong>iOS</strong>: We&#8217;ll continue to target the most recent iOS release.</p>
<p><strong>Android</strong>: Due to some technical limitations in previous Android releases, we are targeting Ice Cream Sandwich and onwards. We will continue to make available the testing framework for Froyo, but will not be making any changes to it.</p>
<p><strong>These are only our plans</strong>. If you really need those browsers, and (better!) can help us maintain support for them, then please let us know.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice that Opera and Chrome are not listed above. Since Opera and Google now maintain the drivers for those browsers, they are best placed to decide which are the supported versions, but in summary, Google support the major Chrome release channels (stable, beta, dev and canary) and Opera suggest using Opera 11.6+.</p>

            <p>If you&#8217;re using Selenium RC to test websites hosted on a secure site (accessed using a URL starting with HTTPS), we strongly recommend that you upgrade to Selenium 2.19. This is because the Cybervillains certificate in previous versions will expire soon, and has been replaced in 2.19 with an updated one.</p>
<p>Our thanks to Patrick Lightbody, Ivan De Marino and Mark Watson and <a href="http://www.neustar.biz/solutions/website-performance">Neustar</a> for taking providing the new certificate and the patch!</p>

            <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2012/announcing-selenium-2-19-the-prancing-unicorn-release/"><h2>Announcing Selenium 2.19: the Prancing Unicorn release</h2></a>
            <p>You might be pleased to hear that Selenium 2.19 has been released (<a href="http://seleniumhq.org/download/">download it from here!</a>). There&#8217;s one big user facing changing that we&#8217;d like to tell you about: the webdriver-backed selenium can now be used in supported languages.</p>
<p>By providing this capability, it&#8217;s possible to migrate from RC to the WebDriver APIs without rewriting all your tests in one fell swoop (which must be a Good Thing, right?) An example of how to use it in Python would be:</p>
<pre class="brush: python; title: ; notranslate" title="">
driver = RemoteWebDriver(desired_capabilities = DesiredCapabilities.FIREFOX)
selenium = DefaultSelenium('localhost', 4444', '*webdriver', 'http://www.google.com')
selenium.start(driver = driver)
</pre>
<p>Provided you keep a reference to the original webdriver and selenium objects you created you can use the two APIs interchangeably.  You&#8217;ll see that the magic is the &#8220;*webdriver&#8221; browser name passed to the selenium instance, and that we pass the webdriver instance when calling start().</p>
<p>We hope you like it!</p>
<p>PS: I have no idea why this is the Prancing Unicorn release, but it&#8217;s been a while since we named one 🙂</p>

<li><a href="https://github.com/github/janky">Janky</a> is GitHub&#8217;s CI server. Seems like this is the current cool route; that is, implementing your own rather than building off of one of the major existing ones. Which I suppose makes sense.</li>

            <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2012/selenium-2-16-released-welcome-to-2012/"><h2>Selenium 2.16 Released: Welcome to 2012!</h2></a>
            <p>It&#8217;s been a while since we last blogged about a Selenium release. Since the release of 2.0, we&#8217;ve been attempting to give you a fresh and shiny Selenium release every week (though, in reality, we&#8217;re managing to get you one every 10 days on average). This allows you to pick the version that&#8217;s most suitable for you and your teams, but provides a route for quick feedback on how we&#8217;re doing. I think we&#8217;ve now ironed out a lot of the initial problems and bumps we ran into, so we are extremely proud to announce the <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/download/">release of Selenium 2.16</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re unsure about what&#8217;s been happening since the last time we announced a release here, the best place to look is our <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/java/CHANGELOG">changelog</a>. The most notable feature in 2.16 is better support for Firefox 9, but if it&#8217;s been a while since you&#8217;ve last updated, we&#8217;ve been beavering away on bug fixes and making existing features work as flawlessly as possible. Now&#8217;s a great time to update!</p>
<p>One of the key tools we use for assessing whether it&#8217;s okay to push a release is our continuous build. This watches for each and every change made to the project&#8217;s source code, and runs an increasingly vast suite of tests to verify that nothing has broken. Our friends at <a href="http://saucelabs.com/">SauceLabs</a> have been extremely generous in providing support for this, and have worked closely with us to make the build as stable and quick as possible. Special kudos and thanks to them!</p>
